<br><h4>Installation Instructions - First Time</h4>
<p>For first-time installations of the LuxCal Event Calendar, follow the 
instructions in the <kbd>installation_guide.html</kbd>.</p>
<br>
<h4>Installation Instructions - Upgrade to a new version</h4>
<p>To upgrade your LuxCal calendar to a new version follow the Upgrade 
Instructions below.</p>
<br>
<h5>Upgrade Instructions</h5>
<h5>Important Notes:</h5>
<ol>
<li>This LuxCal version is a major release with important changes, improvements 
and bug fixes. Before upgrading you may want to read the change log, which can 
be viewed in the release notes on the LuxCal web site in the LuxCal Forum under 
What's New.</li>
<li>
<span class='SQLite'>Before going any further be sure to back up your database, 
via the admin's Database page, or by copying the database file(s) (files with 
extension .cdb) and store the backup file(s) in a safe place.</span>
<span class='MySQL'>Before going any further be sure to back up your database, 
via the admin's Database page, or via an external tool (like phpMyAdmin) and 
store the backup file in a safe place.</span>
</li>
</ol>
<h5 class="redFlag">What you MUST read before upgrading:</h5>
<ul class="redFlag">
<li>Before upgrading create a backup copy of your current calendar database via 
		the Database page of the Administration drop-down menu in the navigation bar 
		of the calendar and backup your full calendar installation (the calendar 
		root folder and all sub-folders) to a temporary location.</li>
<li>Since version 4.5.1 a new "Styling" page has been added to the
		administration drop-down menu, which can be used to tailor the styles 
		(colors, fonts, etc.) of the user interface. This feature however, is not 
		compatible with the former lctheme.php file. <b>When upgrading from an older 
		version, the calendar will revert to the default LuxCal styles and any 
		former style changes will have to be re-applied via this new feature</b>.</li>
<li>Since version 4.5.1 the mini-calendar has been converted into a so-called 
		"display", which has more tailoring options and offers more flexibility. 
		If you are using the mini-calendar, you are advised to switch over to the 
		new mini-calendar display (file name: display0.php), which can be downloaded
		from the LuxCal Displays page on the LuxSoft website.</li>
<li>If you have tailored/edited any files of your current calendar installation, 
		re-apply your changes to the new calendar after successful upgrading.<br>
		Files you may have changed:
		<ul>
		<li>the language files in the "lang/" folder *)</li>
		<li>the context-sensitive Help files in the "help/" folder **)</li>
		<li>the stand-alone side bar style sheet (css_sbar.php) in the "css/" 
		folder **)</li>
		<li>the mini-calendar style sheet (lctheme_mini.php) in the "css/" 
		folder **)</li>
		<li>any other LuxCal files, like program files, etc. *)</li>
		</ul>
		*) you should re-apply your changes to the new files.<br>
		**) you may overwrite the new files with your changed file.</li>
	</ul>
<h5>Thereafter carefully follow the next steps:</h5>
<ol>
<li class='MySQL'>When upgrading from a LuxCal version lower than 2.7.2, first 
		upgrade to LuxCal 2.7.2 (Ask the LuxCal team to send you a LuxCal 2.7.2 
		zip-file).</li>
<li>Delete all LuxCal files and sub-folders in the calendar folder on the 
		server, <span class="redFlag"><b>EXCEPT . . .
		<ul>
		<li>THE FILE lcconfig.php <span class='MySQL'>(if current LuxCal version 
		2.7.2 or greater) OR lcaldbc.dat (if LuxCal version &lt; 2.7.2)</span> IN 
		THE CALENDAR ROOT FOLDER.</li>
		<li class="SQLite">THE SQLite DATABASE FOLDER AND ITS CONTENTS</li>
		<li>THE FOLDERS: attachments, files, logs, reciplists and thumbnails AND 
		THEIR CONTENT.</li>
		</span>
		</ul></b>
		</li>
<li>The LuxCal calendar zip-file you've downloaded contains the following 
		compresssed files: luxcalxxx-calendar.zip and luxcalxxx-toolbox.zip. Unzip 
		the file luxcalxxx-calendar.zip and upload all files and folders to the 
		calendar root on the server. Keep the file luxcalxxx-toolbox.zip for 
		possible later use.</li>
<li>Launch the calendar by browsing to the calendar root on the server. The 
		upgrade script will start automatically and if the upgrade is successful, 
		select Start Calendar.</li>
<li>If the calendar is displayed successfully, delete the following files from 
		the calendar root: <kbd>installxxx.php</kbd> and <kbd>upgradexxx.php</kbd> 
		</li>
<li>If you are using email recipient lists in the emlists folder, copy your 
		email recipient list files to the new reciplists folder.</li>
<li>Save a backup copy of the file <kbd>lcconfig.php</kbd>, located in the 
		calendar root folder, which contains the LuxCal version number and the 
		calendar database credentials.</li>
</ol>
			
<h5>Multiple Calendars</h5>
<p class='MySQL'>This LuxCal version supports multiple calendars sharing the  
same database. These calendars are fully independent and have their own settings 
and styles. The advantage of multiple calendars is that the software is 
installed just once - so easy upgrading - and that only one database is needed. 
For details see the <kbd>installation_guide.html</kbd> - section 4.</p>
<p class='SQLite'>This LuxCal version supports multiple calendars, each using 
its own SQLite calendar database. These calendars are fully independent and have 
their own settings and styles. For details on how to install multiple calendars 
see the <kbd>installation_guide.html</kbd> - section 4.</p>

<h5>Periodic Functions</h5>
<p>Note: If you want to use the calendar's periodic functions, like sending 
email or SMS reminders, exporting events in iCalendar format, etc., you need to 
set up a cron job which runs daily at approximately 2.30 AM and starts the 
<kbd>lcalcron.php</kbd> script in the calendar's root folder. Details on how to 
define a cron job can be found in the header of the file <kbd>lcalcron.php</kbd>.
Depending on the configuration settings, the <kbd>lcalcron.php</kbd> script will 
execute the following functions:</p>
<ul>
<li>sending of email and/or SMS reminders</li>
<li>sending of emails with calendar changes *)</li>
<li>exporting events in iCalendar format *)</li>
<li>checking if events have expired and should be deleted *)</li>
<li>checking if user accounts have expired and should be deleted *)</li>
</ul>
<p>*) if activated on the admin's Settings page</p>

<h5>Language Files</h5>
<p>If you have translated one of the user interface language files into an other 
language, you should be aware of the following.</p>
<p>Each user-interface language is defined in three language files: ({lang} is 
the name of the language)</p>
<ul>
<li>lang/ug-{lang}.php file: User guide for the calendar users</li>
<li>lang/ui-{lang}.php file: User interface texts for the calendar pages</li>
<li>lang/ai-{lang}.php file: User interface texts for the admin pages</li>
</ul>
<p><b>For the language files character encoding "utf-8 without BOM" (BOM = Byte 
Order Mark) is recommended.</b></p>
<p>All language files included in the LuxCal download are up to date with this 
LuxCal version. However, for certain languages we could not translate the new 
and changed texts. These texts were added / changed in English and still need to 
be translated.</p>

<h5>Change Log</h5>
<p>The full change log can be viewed on the <a href="http://www.luxsoft.eu/" 
target="_blank"><b> <i>LuxSoft web site</i></b></a> in the release notes in the 
LuxCal forum under "What's New". A detailed, more technical, list of changes can 
be found in the Developper's Notes in the file DevNotes-xx.txt in the calendar 
root folder.</p>
