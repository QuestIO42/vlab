<a id="lbl-1"></a><h4>1. Introduction</h4>
<p>After the LuxCal calendar has been installed or upgraded, using the <kbd>installation_guide.html</kbd>, 
this Administrator's Guide is meant to help the calendar administrator to set up the more advanced functions 
of the LuxCal calendar and to maintain the calendar so that it's functionality meets the needs of the users 
in the best suitable way.</p>
<p>When logged in as administrator, the administrator functions can be accessed via the side menu (hamburger 
button) in the right upper corner of the calendar.</p>
<p>A good place to start in managing your calendar is to . . .</p>
<ul>
<li>customize the calendar settings via the admin's Settings page</li>
<li>create a number of categories for your events</li> 
<li>edit the default user groups created during the installation or add new user groups</li>
</ul>
<p>To familiarize yourself with the LuxCal calendar's capabilities, it is important to take note of the 
	other function and possibilities described in this section.</p>

<a id="lbl-2"></a><h4>2. Managing the Calendar</h4>
<p>Managing the LuxCal calendar is the responsibility of the calendar administrator, who has all calendar
		access rights.</p>
<p>Managing event categories, user profiles and user groups can be done by either the calendar administrator, 
		or users with 'manager' rights.</p>
<p>In order to change configuration settings, or use other administration functions, you must select Log In 
		on the navigation bar at the top right corner of the screen. Enter the administrator name or email 
		address and the password you specified during the installation, and log in. In the side menu (hamburger 
		button top right) the administration functions will appear.</p>

<a id="lbl-2a"></a><h5>a. Calendar Settings</h5>
<p>The Settings page in the administrator side menu (hamburger button top right) can be used to easily 
		change the calendar's configuration settings which are stored in the <kbd>settings</kbd> table of the 
		database.
		These settings, for instance, define the calendar title, the time zone, the language file to be used for
		the user interface, the default initial view when the calendar is started, the number of weeks/months
		displayed in the various views, the date and time format, etc.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT: Currently the TimeZone is set to &quot;Europe/Amsterdam&quot;. If you are in a different time
		zone, change the TimeZone to your local time zone. See the
		<a href="http://us3.php.net/manual/en/timezones.php" target="_blank">PHP Supported Time Zones</a> for 
		possible values.</p>

<a id="lbl-2b"></a><h5>b. Event Categories</h5>
<p>It is recommended to create a number of categories for your events, each with its own color. Adding 
		categories with different colors - though not required - will greatly enhance the views of the calendar. 
		Categories can be for example: meeting, important, holiday, birthday, etc.</p>
<p>The initial installation has only one category which is named "no cat". To manage categories, select
		Categories in the administrator side menu (hamburger button top right). This takes you to a page with 
		a list of all categories where you can add new categories and edit or delete current categories.</p>
<p>When adding / editing events the defined categories can be selected from a pull down list. The order in
		which categories are displayed in the pull down list is determined by the Sequence field on the
		Categories page.</p>
<p>The field "Repeat" can be used to pre-define recurring events. A category "birthday" or "anniversary" can
		be set to repeat every year. If a repeat value is specified, all events defined in this category will
		repeat as specified. The repeat value specified here will overrule possible user 'repeat' settings.
		If the repeat field is set to "every year" then for events in this event category, which have a birthday 
		year between parentheses specified in their description field, the age will be specified at the end of 
		the event title.</p>
<p>If the "No overlap allowed" check box is checked, events within this category may not overlap. If a user 
		tries to create an event in this category which overlaps with an existing event, an error message 
		with the specified error text will be displayed. This feature can be used when you want to use this 
		event category for booking events. For details on how to create a booking calendar, see Advanced 
		Functions hereafter.</p>
<p>With the field "Default time period" you can specify the default duration of an event in case the user 
		specifies a start time without an end time. This can be useful for instance when using this category 
		for "booking" events which may not overlap (see above).</p>
<p>When the checkbox "Day color" has been checked, the full day cell in the calendar views will get the 
		background color specified below. This may be useful to clearly mark for example holidays, birthdays, 
		or other special days.</p>
<p>The field "Event needs approval" will activate the propose/approve feature for events in this category. 
		For a detailed description, see "Proposing / Approving Events" in section 3 below.</p>
<p>A check mark can be activated which will be displayed in front of the event title for all events in this 
		category. The user can use this check mark to flag events, for example, as "completed". Events in this 
		category will appear in the ToDo list, which can be opened from the calendars navigation bar.</p>
<p>The fields "Text color" and "Background" define the colors used to display events in the calendar assigned
		to this category.</p>
<p>The field "Sequence" defines the location of this event category in the category drop-down menus.</p>

<a id="lbl-2c"></a><h5>c. Calendar User Groups</h5>
<p>The initial installation has a User Group defined for each possible type of user permission. Each 
		calendar user is assigned to one of the existing user groups. User groups can be edited, and new user 
		groups can be added, by users with administrator or manager rights.
		Adding and editing user groups is done via the administrator side menu (hamburger button top right). 
		A user group defines the user access rights of the users assigned to this group and the event 
		categories available to the users in the group. Furthermore a number of check boxes are available to 
		specify whether users in this group may upload event attachments and may enter repeating events, 
		multi-day events and private events. 
		Via a color palette a background color can be selected for each group. On the admin's Settings 
		page the administrator can specify whether calendar events should be displayed with the color of the 
		event category or the color of the group to which the creator of the event belongs.</p>
<p>Possible access rights:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>None</p>
<p>The user - normally the Public User - has no access rights and has to log in to use the calendar.</p></li>
<li><p>View</p>
<p>The user can view the calendar, but has has no rights to add or edit events.</p></li>
<li><p>Post/Edit Own</p>
<p>The user can view the calendar and can add events. The user can only edit his/her own events.</p></li>
<li><p>Post/Edit All</p>
<p>The user can view the calendar and can add events. The user can edit his/her own events as well as  
events of other users.</p></li>
<li><p>Post/Edit + Manager</p>
<p>A user with 'Manager' rights can do the same as a user with 'Post All' rights and in addition:</p>
<p>- Can change the owner of an event (in the Event window). So for instance a manager can create events for 
other users by creating an event and then assign an owner to it.</p>
<p>- Can approve events created by other users. See Advanced Functions hereafter.</p>
<p>- Has access, via the administrator side menu (hamburger button top right), to the Categories, Users and 
		User Groups pages and consequently can manage event categories, user profiles and user groups.</p></li>
<li><p>Administrator</p>
<p>The administrator has all right described above and in addition has access to all technical, user-interface 
and database related settings and functions.</p></li>
</ul>
		
<a id="lbl-2d"></a><h5>d. Calendar Users</h5>
<p>Via the administrator side menu (hamburger button top right) users with manager rights or the calendar 
		administrator can add and edit user profiles. Per user the name, e-mail address, password and the user 
		group can be specified. As described above, the group determines the access rights and the available 
		event categories. It is important to specify a valid email address for the user to be able to receive 
		email notifications of due dates of events. When defined users log in to the calendar they can specify 
		their default user interface language. Thereafter, when a user logs in, the user-interface will be 
		displayed in the specified language.</p>
<p>The initial installation has two users defined. One is the Public Access user, who initially is assigned 
		to the "Read access" user group and the other is the calendar administrator, who is assigned to the 
		"Admin" user group and has all access rights.</p>
<p>Unless the calendar administrator has given &quot;View&quot; access (via the "Read access" user group) 
		to Public Access users, users must log in to use the calendar using their name or email address and 
		password. Depending on the group to which a user has been assigned, a user can have different access 
		rights.</p>
<p>If the administrator has enabled user self-registration on the Settings page, users can register
		themselves via the Login page. Self-registered users will automatically be assigned to the user group 
		for self registered users specified by the administrator on the admin's Settings page and consequently 
		will have the access rights specified for that user group.</p>

<a id="lbl-2e"></a><h5>e. Thumbnail Images</h5>
<p>By adding an image file name to the event's description field or one of the extra fields, a user can
add thumbnail images to events. These thumbnail images must be located in the thumbnails folder and can 
be managed on the Thumbnails page. Thumbnails are shown in the calendar views and in email reminders.</p>
<p>On the Settings page, in the section Views, the administrator can enable / disable the thumbnails in the 
calendar's month view and in the section File Uploads the administrator can specify various settings related 
to the use of thumbnails. On the User Groups page the administrator can specify what rights calendar users 
have to use, upload and delete thumbnails. The allowed thumbnail size in particular is important. Thumbnails 
which are too high will for instance stretch the day cells in month view and can cause undesired effects. 
And the use of many large thumbnails with a big file size may slow down the loading of the calendar pages.</p>

<a id="lbl-2f"></a><h5>f. Calendar Database</h5>
<p>The Database option in the administrator side menu (hamburger button top right) allows the calendar 
administrator to start the following functions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Compact database</p>
<p>During normal use of the calendar, when deleting events, the event records are not physically deleted from
the database, but are marked as 'deleted'. They can still be used in views and reports; for example in the
Changes view.
The compact database function permanently removes events from the database which have been marked as
'deleted' more than 30 days ago. Thereafter all tables are compressed to free unused space and to reduce
database overhead. This action can also be done automatically if a cron job has been created and on the admin's 
Settings page, under Periodic Functions, the number of Event expiry days has been specified.</p></li>
<li><p>Backup database</p>
<p>This function creates a backup file in the <kbd>files/</kbd> folder of the structure and contents of 
all database tables. The file name is <kbd>dump-cal-lcv-yyyymmdd-hhmmss.sql</kbd> (where 'cal' = calendar ID, 
lcv = calendar version and 'yyyymmdd-hhmmss' = year, month, day, hour, minutes and seconds). The file type is 
<kbd>.sql</kbd> and the created file can be downloaded and used to re-create the database tables structure 
and contents, for instance by using the Restore database function (see hereafter) or by importing the file a 
database management tool which is available on the server of most web hosts.</p></li>
<li><p>Restore database</p>
<p>This function uploads the database backup file specified by the administrator and uses this file to 
recreate the calendar database. The database backup file must be of the same calendar version as the 
currently running calendar. The restore function accepts back up files from the MySQL version as well as 
the SQLite version of the calendar, as long as the version number matches the current calendar.</p>
<p> The database will be recreated from scratch, which means that, before recreating a table, the existing 
table and its data will be deleted. For each recreated table the corresponding records from the back-up file 
will be restored to the newly created table.</p>
<p>To restore backup files of older LuxCal versions the "lctool.php" file from the toolbox should be uploaded
to the calendar root and launched via the browser.</p></li>
<li><p>delete / undelete events</p>
<p>With this function the administrator can delete or undelete all events in a specified date range. Deleted 
events will be marked 'deleted', but are not yet physically deleted from the database. When the administrator 
runs the 'compact database' function, described above, events which are physically deleted from the database 
cannot be undeleted anymore.</p>
<p>When selecting this function and a date in the date range is not specified, the default will be 'unlimited'. 
This means that if both start and end date are not specified, all events will be (marked as) deleted / 
undeleted.</p></li>
</ul>

<a id="lbl-2g"></a><h5>g. User Import/Export (CSV File)</h5>
<p>CSV (Comma Separated Values) text files with user account data can be imported into the LuxCal calendar. This
		function can for instance be used to import a CSV file with user account data created by the 
		administrator or exported from a different LuxCal calendar. The LuxCal calendar can also export user 
		account date into a CSV file, which can be downloaded by the calendar administrator. The dialogue to 
		import/export user profile files is opened by selecting User Import (iCal file) / User export (iCal file) 
		from the administrator side menu (hamburger button at the top right).</p>
<p>The CSV file contains one line per user profile and each line contains a number of fields each separated by 
		a comma (or any other unique character). The order of the fields in each line of the CSV file is: user group ID, 
		user name, email address, phone number, language and password".</p>
<p> When exporting user profiles, the password field will contain the md5-encrypted password as stored in the 
		calendar database. This password can not be decrypted!
<p> When importing user profiles, the user name and email address fields are mandatory. If the user group ID 
		field is left blank, the specified default user group ID is taken. If the language field is left blank, 
		the default language specified on the Settings page will be taken. If the password field is left blank or 
		is omitted, the specified default password is taken. 
		Password fields may contain a legible password (e.g. "CathyD-42") or an md5-encrypted password (e.g. from an
		exported user profile file). 
		User names and email addresses must be unique, so when importing, the calendar will check if user names and 
		email addresses in the CSV file are already present in the calendar and if so, highlight the user name and 
		email addresses concerned.
		When the "Replace existing users" check box has been checked, all users, except the public user and the 
		administrator, will be deleted before importing the users from the selected file.
		When importing, the first line of the CSV file can be used for column descriptions and if so, this line is 
		ignored by the import function.</p>
<p>Sample User profile CSV files can be found in the <kbd>files/</kbd> folder of the LuxCal Calendar 
		installation and has the file extension ".csv".</p>

<a id="lbl-2h"></a><h5>h. Event Import/Export (iCal File)</h5>
<p>Events from iCalendar files can be imported into the LuxCal calendar. The content of the iCal file to be
		imported must meet the [<u><a href='http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5545' target='_blank'>RFC5545
		standard</a></u>] of the Internet Engineering Task Force. The LuxCal calendar can also export events
		into an iCal file which can be downloaded by the calendar administrator. The dialogue to import/export
		iCal files is opened by selecting Event Import / iCal export (iCal file) from the administrator side menu 
		(hamburger button top right).</p>
		<p>This function can for instance be used to back up the events of your LuxCal calendar, or to exchange
		events with other calendars, e.g. to import public holidays available in iCalendar format on the internet.
		Please note that some LuxCal event fields are not supported in the iCalendar format (e.g. private event, notify,
		email addresses) and consequently are not copied to the iCal file. Some iCal event repetition rules are not
		supported by the LuxCal calendar; these events will be displayed and earmarked as such, but will not be
		added to the calendar.</p>
<p>Various sample iCal files can be found in the <kbd>files/</kbd> folder of the LuxCal Calendar
		installation and have the file extension ".ics".</p>

<a id="lbl-2i"></a><h5>i. Event Import (CSV File)</h5>
<p>CSV (Comma Separated Values) text files with event data can be imported into the LuxCal calendar. This
		function can for instance be used to import a CSV file with event data exported by MS Outlook. The dialogue
		to import CSV files is opened by selecting Event Import (CSV file) from the administrator side menu (hamburger 
		button top right).</p>
<p>The CSV file contains one line per event and each line contains a number of fields each separated by a comma
		(or any other unique character). The order of the fields in each line of the CSV file is: title, venue,
		category id, date, end date, start time, end time and description. The first line of the CSV file is ignored
		by the import function and can be used for column descriptions (default in MS Outlook exports).</p>
<p>Sample CSV files - with different date/time formats - can be found in the <kbd>files/</kbd> folder of the
		LuxCal Calendar installation and have the file extension ".csv".</p>

<a id="lbl-2j"></a><h5>j. User Interface Styling</h5>
<p>The UI Styling page in the administrator side menu (hamburger button top right) allows the calendar 
		administrator to tailor the styles (text and background colors, fonts family and sizes, etc.) of most 
		elements of the calendar's user interface.</p>
<p>The Styling page opens in a separate window, which makes it possible to preview style changes in the 
		calendar pages, by browsing the calendar, while the Styling page remains open.</p>
<div>Buttons and drop-down menu at the top of the page:</div>
<ul>
<li><b>Preview Theme</b>: When pressed, the currently displayed theme will be temporary activated for the 
		calendar and a Stop Preview button will be displayed. The calendar can now be browsed with these styles, 
		until the Stop Preview button is selected.</li>
<li><b>Save Theme</b>: The displayed theme will be saved to the database and from now on this theme will be 
		used by this calendar. The previous theme in the database will be overwritten. When the theme is saved 
		for the first time since the Styling page is opened, prior to overwriting the theme in the database, 
		an automatic backup will be stored in a file in the css folder; the file extension will be "abak".</li>
<li><b>Backup Theme</b>: The theme from the database will be stored in a file in the css folder. The name 
		given to the file will be shown in the information line at the top of the window. The file extension 
		will be "mbak".</li>
<li><b>Restore Theme</b>: This drop-down menu will show the LuxCal default theme and all backup files 
		(".abak" and ".mbak") in the css folder. When an entry is selected the theme from the selected file 
		will be displayed in the Styling page. This theme can then be previewed, modified and saved.</li>
<li><b>Close Window</b>: Close the Styling window. If there are unsaved changes, a warning will be 
		displayed.</li>
<li><b>Theme title</b>: Optional theme title which will be stored along with the styles in the database 
		and in backup files. If left blank, this field will default to the calendar title.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since calendar styles are saved in the calendar database, in case of multiple calendars, each calendar 
has its own styles.</p>

<a id="lbl-2k"></a><h5>k. Adding Your Logo to the Calendar</h5>
<p>On the administrator's Settings page, in the section General, you can specify a path and name of a logo 
	image. Once the image has been uploaded to the server and the path and name have been specified on the 
	Settings page, the logo will be displayed in the left upper corner of the calendar pages. The buttons on 
	the navigation bar will shift right the required number of pixels to make place for the logo. The logo 
	will also be displayed in the left upper corner of possible email messages sent by the calendar</p>
<p>If on the Settings page, in the section General, also a link to a parent page has been specified, then 
	the logo will become the hyperlink to the parent page.</p>
<p>The maximum logo image width and/or height is 70 x 70 pixels.</p>

<a id="lbl-2l"></a><h5>l. Side Panel in Month, Week and Day View</h5>
<p>On the administrator's Settings page, in the section Views, with the setting "Side panel in Month, Week 
and Day view" you can select to show a side panel right next to the main calendar with one or more of the 
following items:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>a mini calendar</b> which can be used to look back or ahead without changing the date of the main 
calendar. When hovering the event squares in the mini calendar an overly with event details will be shown.</li>
<li><b>a decoration image</b> corresponding to the current month. Each calendar month can have its own 
image. The image files should be present in the folder specified on the Settings page. The image file 
names must start with a 2-digit month number followed by a free name and should have extension .jpg, .gif 
or .png. Examples of image file names: 01photo.jpg, 02animate.gif, 12xmas.png. The images are displayed 
with a fixed width of 292 pixels; to keep page loading times to a minimum, the image widths should 
preferably be close to 292 pixels and their heights may vary. If for a month no image file is found, no 
image will be displayed in the side panel.</li>
<li><b>an info area</b> to post textual information, which can be used to show messages or announcements 
to calendar users. All messages should be stored in the info.txt file in the calendar's "sidepanel" folder.
Info messages can be displayed during one month or during several months. Each message must be preceded 
by a line with the month number or a range of month numbers between ~ characters in the following format: 
~4~ (one month: April) or ~8-10~ (range of months: August, September and October).
These text messages may contain HTML tags. If for a month no message is found, no info area will be 
displayed in the side panel. An example info.txt file can be found in the 'sidepanel/samples' folder</li>
</ul>
<p>The side panel will not be shown if no side panel items are selected on the settings page or when the 
calendar is viewed on a narrow width display.</p>
<p>The sub-folder "samples" of the sidepanel folder contains several sample images and info files. 
To see the effect of side panel images and info messages, these files should be copied from the samples 
folder to the sidepanel folder and should be activated on the Settings page.</p>

<a id="lbl-2m"></a><h5>m. Logging Calendar Data</h5>
<p>On the administrator's Settings page, in the section General, you can specify which data shall be logged 
by the calendar. Logged data is stored in text files in the calendar's "logs" folder. The calendar can log 
the following data:</p>
<ul>
<li>Error messages: Error messages related to SQL database queries are stored in the file sql.log and other 
error messages are logged in the file luxcal.log. Error messages are always logged! Note: Messages produced 
by the PHP language processor are stored in a different place on the server which is defined by your 
service provider (ISP).</li>
<li>Cronjob start/end messages: When a cronjob has been defined to start the calendar's periodic functions 
(for instance event reminders), the start and the end of the cronjob will be logged in the luxcal.log file. 
Cronjob start/end messages are always logged!</li>
<li>Warning messages: Warning messages are logged in the luxcal.log file. The logging of warning messages 
can be switched on and off.</li>
<li>Notice messages: Notice messages are logged in the luxcal.log file. The logging of notice messages can 
be switched on and off.</li>
<li>Visitors data: The following visitors data is logged:
<ul>
<li>Date, time, host, browser and visited pages of calendar users are logged in the file hitlog.log. Data of 
calendar users with administrator or manager rights are not logged.</li>
<li>Date, time, host, browser and visited pages of web bots are logged in the file botlog.log.</li>
<li>A counter with the number of visits of calendar users is logged in the file hitcnt.log.</li>
<li>A counter with the number of visits of web bots is logged in the file botcnt.log.</li>
</ul>
The logging of visitors data can be enabled/disabled. When logging of visitors data is switched on, a visits 
counter will be shown in the left lower corner of the calendar. For users with manager or administrator 
rights the counter is a hyper-link and when clicked will show the contents of the hitlog.log file in a new 
window.
</li>
</ul>
<p>IMPORTANT:</p>
<ul>
<li>From time to time the calendar administrator should scan the logs folder and files for any 
peculiarities and purge long log files.</li>
<li>The "logs" folder is web accessible and the files in this folder can be read by anyone.</li>
</ul>

		
<a id="lbl-3"></a><h4>3. Advanced Functions</h4>
<p>The normal day-to-day use of the calendar is explained in the help file which can be viewed by opening 
	the side menu (hamburger button top right) and selecting 'Help'. There are however a number of more 
	advanced functions which can be enabled / configured by users with manager rights or by the calendar 
	administrator.</p>
<p> These advanced functions are described hereafter.</p>

<a id="lbl-3a"></a><h5>a. Changing the Lay-out of Events</h5>
<p>On the Settings page, the admin can specify which fields of the event body are in use and in which order 
they will be displayed in the various views. This can be done via the 'Event template' under <kbd>Events</kbd> 
by specifying a sequence of numbers in the range 1 - 7, where each number represents an event field.</p>
<p>Possible fields in the event body:</p>
<ul>
<li>1: Venue field</li>
<li>2: Event category field</li>
<li>3: Description field</li>
<li>4: Extra field 1</li>
<li>5: Extra field 2</li>
<li>6: Email notification data (only if an email notification has been requested</li>
<li>7: Date/time added/edited and the associated users</li>
</ul>
<p>Fields (numbers) which are not specified, will not be visible in the calendar views. Extra fields 1 and 2 
are extra fields for which the admin can specify a dedicated label on the same Settings page under Events. 
If the these fields have been specified, the field label as well as the content will be displayed. In the 
calendar views active fields which are empty will not be shown. The Event window will of course always 
show all active fields, including the empty fields.</p>
<p>Example: Event template "43126", with the label for Extra field 1 set to "Department", will for instance result 
in the following event body lay-out (explanation between brackets):</p>
<p>&nbsp;<i>Department: Sales</i> (extra field 1 with label "Department")<br>
&nbsp;<i>Emmett Brown will be working on-site for the BTTF project.</i> (description)<br>
&nbsp;<i>Venue: Hill Valley</i> (venue)<br>
&nbsp;<i>Category: Absent</i> (event category)<br>
&nbsp;(<i>Notify: 4 day(s)</i>) (This line is not displayed, because no email notification was requested)
</p>
<p>On the Settings page, the fields 'Event fields - general hover box' under Events, 'Event fields - mini 
calendar hover box' under Mini Calendar and 'Event fields - sidebar hover box' under Stand-Alone Sidebar 
can be used by the admin to specify the event fields to be displayed in the various hover boxes. The 
sequence of the fields in the hover boxes depend on the event template described before.</p>

<a id="lbl-3b"></a><h5>b. Adding Attachments to Events</h5>
<p>Users belonging to a User group for which File Upload is enabled, can add pdf, image and video attachments 
to events. Adding and removing attachments to events can be done in the Event window when adding or 
editing events. The actual attachment file is stored in the calendar's subfolder "attachments" and the 
link from the event to the file is saved in the event record in the calendar database. 
Uploaded attachments will be shown as hyperlinks in the event data in the various calendar views. When 
clicking these hyperlinks, the attachment will open in a new window.</p>
<p>When an attachment file is stored in the attachment folder, its file name is prefixed with the 
current date and time. E.g 20200127203557Agenda.pdf.</p>
<p>On the administrators Settings page, under Views, in the Event templates it can be specified if and 
at what position within the event data hyperlinks to attachments should be displayed in the various 
calendar views.</p>

<a id="lbl-3c"></a><h5>c. Event Check Mark and To Do List</h5>
<p>On the admin's Categories page, when adding/editing an event category, if you select "Check mark" and 
specify a label and a check mark, events in this category will have a check mark displayed just in front 
of the event title in the various views. For the owner of the event and users with "manager" rights this 
check mark is a hyperlink and, when clicked, will result in checking/unchecking the check mark. This 
feature can be used for instance to mark an event as "complete" or "done". Events with a check mark will 
show up in the To Do list, which - when enabled by the administrator - can be selected from the 
calendar's side menu (hamburger button top right).</p>

<a id="lbl-3d"></a><h5>d. Proposing / Approving Events</h5>
<p>On the admin's Categories page, when adding/editing an event category, if you select "Events need 
approval", users with post rights can - in this category - create events which are not visible to other 
users until a user with at least "manager" rights has approved the event. Until the event has been 
approved, no user other than the event owner and users with manager rights will see the event. The owner 
and users with manager rights will see the proposed event in the various views displayed with a red bar 
in the left margin. Once a user with "manager" rights has approved the event, the event owner will 
receive a confirmation email and the event will become visible to all users. Thereafter the event will 
be locked and cannot be edited anymore by the originator. A user with at least manager rights can still 
edit the event. Of course, if you don't like the words "proposing" and "approving", you change them in 
the language files.</p>

<a id="lbl-3e"></a><h5>e. Private Events</h5>
<p>When adding/editing events, if the "Private" check box is checked, the event will only be visible 
to the user who created the event and to the administrator. For obvious reasons private events can 
only be created by logged in users.</p>
<p>On the Settings page, under Events, the administrator can set "posting of private events to 
disabled, enabled, default and always with the following meaning:</p>
<ul>
<li>disabled: The "Private" check box will not be visible in the Event window, so no private events can
 be created.</li>
<li>enabled: The "Private" check box will be visible in the Event window and will initially be 
unchecked.</li>
<li>default: The "Private" check box will be visible in the Event window and will initially be 
checked.</li>
<li>always: The "Private" check box will not be visible in the Event window and all created events 
will be private.</li>
</ul>
<p>The creation of private events can also be enabled/disabled per individual user group (see 
Calendar User Groups above). If for a calendar user group private events have been disabled, this 
will overrule the "Posting of private events = always" setting on the admin's Settings page.</p>

<a id="lbl-3f"></a><h5>f. Using the Calendar to Book Events</h5>
<p>Event categories of the calendar can be set up for booking events with event overlap checking. 
The idea is to let users create events which may not overlap with already existing events in the 
same event category or with events in any category. If a user tries to create an event which overlaps, 
an error message will be displayed. Single-day, multi-day and recurring events are checked. 
Private events are not checked. The overlap check is performed when a new event is added to the 
calendar or an existing event is edited. The overlap check starts from the first date until the 
end date of the event and for recurring events without end date, the check will continue until 
two years after the actual date. Optionally a minimum time gap which should be respected between two 
events can be specified.</p>
<p>How to set up a booking system, is illustrated by the following example.</p>
<h6>Billiard table booking example:</h6>
<p>In this example we will set up a booking system for three billiard tables.</p>
<p>Create a new event category and give it the name "Billiard table 1", check the "No overlap 
allowed" check box for the same category, specify a time gap required between two bookings and 
specify the error text that will be displayed when trying to create an event which overlaps with 
an existing event; e.g."Billiard table 1 in use, choose an other time or table". If desired, a 
default or fixed event duration can be specified, which - when creating / editing an event - 
will automatically be added to the start time of an event. Give this category a color 
(text/background) which belongs to table 1.
<br>
Create two more categories for the other two billiard tables in a similar way but with a 
different name, error text and color.
<br>
Now a user group can be created, for instance with the name "Billiards" for those users who can 
book one of the three billiard tables. For this user group the three categories created for the 
billiard tables should be selected and the check box "May post private events" should be unchecked. 
Because the billiard tables can only be booked for a limited time, the check box "May post 
multi-day events" can also be unchecked. So now if a user in this group add/edits an event, 
the Event window will be simplified and will contain no "Private" check box, no "End date" field 
and no "Repeat" feature.
<br>
On the Settings page, under User Accounts, "Self registration" can be enabled and the "Self 
registration user group" should be set to the user group "Billiards" created in the step above.
</p>
<p>In the above example, users can register themselves and will be part of the "billiard" user 
group; they will have access to the three categories "Billiard table 1", "Billiard table 2" and 
"Billiard table 3" and will only be able to book a billiard table which is free.</p>
<p>Note: For a booking system for chalets for instance, in the user group the check box "May post 
multi-day events" should remain checked, to allow for booking the chalets for several days.</p>

<a id="lbl-3g"></a><h5>g. Sending Event Reminder Messages</h5>
<p>The calendar has an email event reminder service and an SMS event reminder service. For the SMS 
reminder service a subscription with a mail-to-SMS provider will be needed. The settings related 
to these services can be set on the administrator's Settings page in the Reminders section. Both 
services can be enabled/disabled individually.</p>
<p>To be able to send reminders a specified number of days before the start of an event, a cronjob 
must be defined, which starts the script lcalcron.php in the calendar root daily at approx. 2am</p>
<p>Users belonging to a user group with edit rights, can ask to send email reminders when adding or 
editing events. Users can also ask to send SMS reminders, provided the user group the user belongs 
to has the rights to send SMS reminders.</p>
<p>A user can ask the calendar to send an email or SMS reminder, directly or a number of days before 
the start of an event. If the user selects to send an email and/or an SMS directly, the email and/or 
SMS is sent as soon as the event is saved. If the user ask to send an email and/or SMS x days 
before the start of the event, an email and/or SMS will be sent x days before the start of the 
event and another one will be sent on the day of the event. If the user specifies to send an email 
and/or SMS 0 (zero) days before the start of the event, an email and/or SMS will be sent on the 
day of the start of the event only. For recurring events (e.g. birthdays) an email/SMS notification 
will be sent to the recipients the selected number of days before each occurrence of the event.</p>
<p>Email as well as SMS reminders are sent to the recipients specified in the recipients list. 
Recipients can be specified by means of an email address or a mobile phone number. 
For email reminders to a recipient with a mobile phone number, the calendar will use the phone 
number to search the user accounts in the database for a matching email address. If not found, 
no email reminder will be sent. For SMS reminders to a recipient with an email address, the 
calendar will use the email address to search the user accounts in the database for a matching 
phone number. If not found, no SMS reminder will be sent.<br>If the email address or the phone 
number is followed by a $-sign, the calendar will not look for a matching phone number or mail 
address.</p>
<p>Scheduled reminders and/or SMSes are always sent early in the morning, when the cronjob runs.</p>

<a id="lbl-3h"></a><h5>h. Sidebar with Upcoming Events or Todo List</h5>
<p>A stand-alone sidebar with upcoming events or a Todo list (see above) can be integrated in your 
web page. An advantage of the sidebar, compared to embedding the calendar in an html iframe, is 
that the sidebar is displayed in a &lt;div&gt; container and can be freely styled to match the style 
of your web page. A second advantage is that the hoverbox with many event details is not clipped 
by iframe boundaries.
Further detail on how to add one or more stand-alone sidebars to your web page can be found in the 
<kbd>installation_guide.html</kbd>. Examples of what a sidebar can look like can be found on the 
LuxSoft <a href="http://www.luxsoft.eu/index.php?pge=demo" target="_blank"><b><i>Demo page</i></b></a>.
</p>

<a id="lbl-3i"></a><h5>i. Color-coding of Events and Subcategories</h5>
<p>When defining user groups, for each group a background color can be specified and when defining event 
categories, a text color and a background color can be specified for each category. On the admin's 
Settings page, under Events, the admin can select whether on the calendar pages the color of the event 
titles in the various views should correspond to the color of the user group to which the originator 
of the event belongs or to the event category to which the event belongs.</p>
<p>When adding/editing event categories a check box "Day color" can be checked. If this check box is 
checked, in the various calendar views, if an event in this category is displayed for a certain day, 
the background of the whole day will take the color of the event. This can for instance be useful to 
make special events, like holidays or birthdays, more visible.</p>
<p>On the categories page, for each event category up to four subcategories can be specified. Each 
subcategory has a name and optionally the text color and background color can be specified. If one or 
more subcategories have been specified, in the event add/edit window a drop-down menu will be displayed 
from which the user can select a subcategory. When the subcategory has been selected, in all calendar 
views the event concerned will take the text and background color of the selected subcategory and the 
subcategory name will be added to the event details. When specifying subcategories on the categories 
page, the text/background color fields can also be left blank; in this case the events in this category 
will take the normal category colors. It may be useful for instance to specify a subcategory "None" 
without colors, which - when selected in the event add/edit window - will behave as if no subcategory 
has been selected.</p>

<a id="lbl-3j"></a><h5>j. Importing Data of Previous LuxCal Versions</h5>
<p>There are different ways to import calendar data of previous LuxCal versions, back to LuxCal version 
2.7.2. If you want to import data of a LuxCal version less than 2.7.2, read the Upgrade Instructions 
in the Release Notes (release_notes_xxx.html, where xxx = the LuxCal version).</p>
<ul>
<li>Upgrading the calendar</li>
<p>When upgrading the calendar to a newer version, following the upgrade steps in the Release Notes, 
the calendar(s) in the database will automatically be upgraded to the new Calendar version.</p>
<li>Importing data via the LuxCal Toolbox (see section 4 below)</li>
<p>The lctools.php file from the calendar toolbox can be uploaded to the calendar root folder and 
launched via the browser. Via these tools a database back up files of a previous LuxCal version (as 
of LuxCal 2.7.2) can be imported. At the end of the import process, the database schema will be 
upgraded to the current calendar version without loss of data. Thereafter the calendar can be started.</p>
<li>Importing data via an external tool</li>
<p>You can use an external tool on your server, e.g. phpMyAdmin or phpLiteAdmin, to import database 
back up files of previous LuxCal versions directly into the database. Before starting the calendar, 
the upgradexxx.php file should be uploaded to the calendar root folder on your server and be launched 
via your browser. Thereafter the calendar can be started.</p>
</ul>
<p>When in doubt if the calendar data in your database is up to date, you can at any time upload the 
upgradexxx.php file to the calendar root folder on your server and launch it. The script will verify, 
and if necessary upgrade, the database schema of your calendar(s).</p>

<a id="lbl-4"></a><h4>4. LuxCal Toolbox</h4>
<p>The toolbox contains several tools and utilities, which can help you set up and manage your calendar. 
Below you will find a short description of each of the tools / utilities.</p>

<a id="lbl-4a"></a><h5>4a. PHP Installation Details</h5>
<p>On the admin's Settings page, in the General section, under Versions, just after the PHP version, 
there is a "Show info" link. Clicking this link will display all details of the PHP installation on 
your server in a new window. The PHP installation details can be useful when a PHP related problem is 
encountered.</p>

<a id="lbl-4b"></a><h5>4b. General Toolbox - lctools.php</h5>
<p>The lctool.php file should be uploaded to the calendar's root folder and launched via your browser.
This toolbox is particularly useful when managing multiple calendars. It contains tools to perform 
the following actions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Test the configuration</li>
<li>Create new calendars</li>
<li>Set the default calendar</li>
<li>Delete calendars</li>
<li>Replicate data and/or settings from file</li>
<li>Back up calendars</li>
<li>Download a backup file from the 'files' folder</li>
<li>Import a calendar backup file of a previous LuxCal version</li>
</ul>
<p>Most actions should be used with caution. Always carefully read the displayed instruction!</p>

<a id="lbl-4c"></a><h5>4c. SMTP Mail Test Utility - smtptest.php</h5>
<p>When you prefer to use SMTP mail, rather than PHP mail, for your email reminders and cron job 
reports, you can select SMTP mail on the admin's Settings page of your calendar. Before doing so you 
can use the SMTP Mail Test Utility "smtptest.php", in the smtpmail folder, to test your SMTP mail and 
its parameters. The smtptest.php file should be uploaded to the calendar's root folder on your 
server. Before launching it via your browser, you should start the calendar and specify the SMTP 
parameters on the admin's Settings page, under Reminders.</p>

<a id="lbl-4d"></a><h5>4d. Database Administration with phpLiteAdmin</h5>
<p>In the phpliteadmin folder you will find phpLiteAdmin, an easy to use web-based SQLite database admin 
tool written in PHP. details on how to use this free tool can be found 
<a href="https://code.google.com/p/phpliteadmin/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>In the associated phpliteadmin.config.php file, you should at least set the following variables:</p>
<ul>
<li>$password - password to gain access</li>
<li>$directory - directory of the database file(s) (default for LuxCal: "../db/")</li>
<li>$allowed_extensions - array with allowed database file extensions (for LuxCal: ".cdb")</li>
</ul>

<a id="lbl-5"></a><h4>5. Calendar Settings - Description</h4>
<p>The calendar settings which are automatically generated during the installation process are stored in
the <kbd>settings</kbd> table of the database. All settings can be changed by the calendar administrator 
via the Settings page in the administrator side menu (hamburger button top right).</p>
<p>For those interested in technical details: The following are explanations of the PHP variables stored
in the <kbd>settings</kbd> table of the database:</p>
